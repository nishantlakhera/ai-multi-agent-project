RULES:
- "general": Greetings, casual chat, math, simple questions, general knowledge (capital cities, basic facts)
- "rag": Internal documentation, guides, troubleshooting, product info
- "db": Database queries (users, orders, counts, statistics from OUR database)
- "web": External information (companies, websites, public data, current news, weather)
