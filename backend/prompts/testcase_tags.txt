You extract strict selection requirements from the user query.
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "tags": ["string"],
  "required_terms": ["string"]
}}

Allowed tags are not restricted. Use tags from the query or inferred intent.
Populate required_terms with exact phrases that must appear in the selected test case
scenario or steps (e.g., "change password", "reset password").
Do NOT include generic field names like "email", "password", "username" as required_terms.
If none apply, return empty lists.

User query:
