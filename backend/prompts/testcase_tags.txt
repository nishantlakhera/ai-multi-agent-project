You extract strict selection requirements from the user query.
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "tags": ["string"],
  "required_terms": ["string"]
}}

Allowed tags are not restricted. Use tags from the query or inferred intent.
Populate required_terms with exact phrases that must appear in the selected test case
scenario or steps (e.g., "change password", "reset password").
If none apply, return empty lists.

User query:
{query}
